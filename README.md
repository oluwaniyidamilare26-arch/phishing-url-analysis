## Overview
This project analyzes a suspected phishing URL using a combination of technical tools and security frameworks.  
I produced two reports: one for executives and one for technical audiences.

- **Technical_Report.pdf** → A deep-dive technical analysis covering methodology, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs).  
- **VirusTotal_Analysis.json files** → Outputs from VirusTotal showing threat detection results.

## Tools & Techniques Used

- OSINT investigation


## Key Takeaways
- Demonstrated ability to analyze malicious URLs.  
- Showcased skill in writing reports for both technical and non-technical audiences.
